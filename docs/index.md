# Welcome to viewdocs-yeti

Viewdocs is [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) meets [Gist.io](http://gist.io/) for simple project documentation. It renders Markdown from your repository's `docs` directory as simple static pages.

### Getting Started

Just make a `docs` directory in your Github project repository and put an `index.md` file in there to get started. Then browse to:

    http://<github-username>.viewdocs.io/<repository-name>

Any other Markdown files in your `docs` directory are available as a subpath, including files in directories. You can update pages by just pushing to your repository or editing directly on Github. It can take up to 1-2 minutes before changes will appear.

This page is an example of what documentation will look like by default. Here is [another example page](example). The source for these pages are in the [docs directory](https://github.com/fgrehm/viewdocs-yeti/tree/master/docs) of the Viewdocs project.
